        <h2 class="about">About Us</h2>
        <p>
            As we aware that our India's Old Civilization,
            knowledge, Traditional system, Treatments has been
            a Centre of attraction & had a great emphasis to the
            whole world and many developed countries has
            eyes on our Traditional system since ancient times &
            India have faced Biopiracy & deception several times
            like:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-items">
            <li>USA has filed nearly 54 patents on Neem</li>
            <li>Haldi or Turmeric was a part of India but Patented in Us</li>
            <li>Our Basmati rice have been patented by American company</li>
            <li>Patents have also filed on Meditation By USPTO & Many more Patents have been filed which was part of our country</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So we can observe that many important things have
            been already grasped from India so we have to take
            some serious steps to save our remaining treasure of
            Indian system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conclusion is that we can conserve remaining
            Tradition by making the organisation for Research
            work on various Herbs , Old Methods, Treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Research work system, we will allow many
            Experts of their own field like Doctors, Therapist,
            Para -Medical Staff , other Experts also ,so that
            perfectly we can perform and see the result and then
            get patented on each and every research we do and
            provide courses & Certificate also to the Workers
            who are willing to join in this work.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can do research on many therapies including
            Ayurvedic, Naturopathy, Yoga , Pranayama ,
            Meditation other therpies like Chanting Mantras
            ,Yagya / Hawan & observing their effects , Cow
            Therapy, Tree huging therapy, Grounding or
            reflexology , Astrology, Palmistry, Face reading,
            Vastushastra, Our old system of Cooking methods ,
            Right Utensils for cooking & researches on many
            other Systems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be done Under the Umbrella of AMOGH
            (Alternative Medicine Organization for Global Health
            ) or by making the New Organisation for this
            purpose . We can Surely do this project by getting
            International support by joining Hands to Hands
            together and reserve our remaining traditional
            System.
